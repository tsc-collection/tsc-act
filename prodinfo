  Provides facility for creating custom test suites for
  acceptance/regression testing. The engine allows interfacing a system to
  be tested through a variety of means such as a process on a local host
  via a PTY (pseudo terminal), a network host via TELNET, an MVS host via
  3270 protocol, etc. An internal screen image for the system under test
  is constantly maintained, with ability to examine it and to handle
  various events. Input to the system under test can be generated with
  support for functional keys. Ruby test/unit framework is readily
  available for assertions.
