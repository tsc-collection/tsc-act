# Provides facility for creating custom test suites for
# acceptance/regression testing. The engine allows interfacing a system to
# be tested through a variety of means such as a process on a local host
# via a PTY (pseudo terminal), a network host via TELNET, an MVS host via
# 3270 protocol, etc. An internal screen image for the system under test
# is constantly maintained, with ability to examine it and to handle
# various events. Input to the system under test can be generated with
# support for functional keys. Ruby test/unit framework is readily
# available for assertions.
